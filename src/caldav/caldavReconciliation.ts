/**
 * Conflict resolution and sync planning.
 *
 * The two mechanisms that decide what actually happens to a user's data live
 * here, deliberately separated from all I/O so they can be tested exhaustively:
 *
 *   - `resolveConflict` — ETag mismatch has already told us both sides changed;
 *     this decides which one wins.
 *   - `planFirstSync` / `planIncrementalSync` — what to upload, import, link or
 *     resolve. `planFirstSync` is also what the dry-run preview renders.
 *
 * Pure: no Obsidian runtime, no network, no DOM or timer globals.
