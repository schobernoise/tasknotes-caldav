/**
 * Task relationships as iCalendar `RELATED-TO` (RFC 5545 §3.8.4.5, RFC 9253).
 *
 * TaskNotes has no parent field: a subtask is a task whose `projects` array
 * links to its parent, so `projects` *is* the parent relation and, being
 * many-valued, maps directly onto repeated `RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=PARENT` lines.
 * Dependencies map just as directly — `TaskDependency` is already shaped like
 * RFC 9253's temporal relation, carrying a reltype and an optional `GAP`.
 *
 * Relation targets are VTODO UIDs, not vault paths. Resolving between the two
 * needs Obsidian's metadata cache, so it stays in CalDavSyncService; this
 * module only ever speaks UIDs.
 *
 * Pure: no Obsidian runtime, no network, no DOM or timer globals.
